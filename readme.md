  ```
- Run the compiled program:
  ```
  ./dynamic_table
  ```

### 2. Main Menu

Upon running the program, you'll encounter a user-friendly main menu offering a variety of options. Here's an in-depth look at each menu item:

1. **Insert Topic**: Add a new column (topic) to your dynamic table.
2. **Insert Data**: Insert data into the table at a specified row and column.
3. **Delete Topic**: Remove a column (topic) and all associated data.
4. **Delete Data**: Eliminate specific data at a given row and column.
5. **Delete Row**: Erase an entire row along with its data.
6. **Display Table**: View the table in a neatly formatted tabular layout.
7. **Display Topics**: Display the column names (topics) alongside their respective keys.
8. **Enter Specific Data for All Rows**: Quickly populate the entire table with data.
9. **Save Data to File**: Save the current state of the table to a text file.
10. **Load Data from File**: Retrieve previously saved data from a file.
11. **Quit**: Exit the program.

### 3. Functionality Instructions

To utilize the program's features effectively, adhere to these guidelines:

- Carefully follow the on-screen prompts and input instructions for each operation.
- You have the flexibility to name topics (columns) and manage data (rows) dynamically.

### 4. Data Storage

Data storage and retrieval are facilitated through a file named "data.txt" by default. You have the option to customize the filename as needed within the `main` function.

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements to further empower the Dynamic Table Management System:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to manage access control effectively. Users can be assigned varying levels of access rights, enhancing data security.

2. **Data Validation**: Enhance data input validation mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs, providing a more user-friendly experience.

3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implement undo and redo functionality, enabling users to revert changes and improve data integrity.

4. **Database Integration**: Integrate the system with a robust database management system to facilitate advanced data handling, scalability, and long-term data storage.

5. **Support Data Types**: Extend support to various data types (e.g., strings, dates) in addition to integers, expanding the system's versatility.

6. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify user interactions and enhance usability.

7. **Search and Filter**: Incorporate search and filter capabilities to help users quickly locate specific data within the table, improving data exploration.

8. **Data Visualization**: Introduce data visualization features to generate charts and graphs based on the table's contents, aiding in data analysis.

9. **Concurrency Control**: Implement mechanisms for concurrency control to manage simultaneous access by multiple users, preventing data conflicts.

10. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide users with informative error messages, streamlining troubleshooting.

11. **Data Export**: Enable users to export data to various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel), promoting data sharing and analysis.

12. **Data Import**: Allow users to import data from external sources (e.g., CSV files), facilitating data migration and integration.
